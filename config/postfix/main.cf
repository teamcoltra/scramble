# WHEN INSTALLING POSTFIX, CHOOSE THE "Internet site" CONFIGURATION
# APPEND THE FOLLOWING TO /etc/postfix/main.cf

# Postfix cannot bind ipv4 port 25---Scramble needs to do that.
# Ideally, we would not bind any port at all---we need Postfix
# only for sending, not receiving---but sadly that's not an option.
#
# As a hack, bind ipv6 only, so there's no conflict.
