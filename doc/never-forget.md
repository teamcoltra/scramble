Never Forget
====
by DC, 9/11/13

Twelve years ago today, I was eleven, and my family was travelling in Alaska. I was sitting on a small ferry in the Price William Sound. The passengers huddled in groups, staring at old TV screens, watching the news play the same clips over and over again. It was far away, but felt close. One lady was crying. The tiny port in Homer, AK declared heightened security, so we floated an extra half hour on the lurching waves before the boat was allowed to dock.

A lot of things changed.

We went to war, then to another war. We declared victory. The wars went on. We passed the Patriot Act with nearly unanimous support. We added a whole new department of government, the Department of Homeland Security, and under it new agencies like the TSA. And until this year it was a government secret, but now we know: we also built the broadest surveillance mechanism in the world.

[George Bush gave a speech nine days after the attack](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/bushaddress_092001.html) that announced a lot of these changes. I recommend you read it. It's short and surprisingly eloquent. With the benefit of hindsight, though, some parts are painful to read.

> Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign unlike any other we have ever seen. 
> It may include dramatic strikes visible on TV and covert operations secret even in success.

Then there's the most famous line.

> Americans are asking, "Why do they hate us?" [...] They hate our freedoms

That sentiment has since been widely mocked, but I think it has a grain of truth. 
Osama bin Laden even released a tape three years later gloating about the Patriot Act and about Americans losing their liberties.
And if fundamentalists do in fact "hate our freedoms", then the way to win is to assert our freedoms even more boldly than before.

Sadly it hasn't worked out that way. Instead, we've allowed ourselves to be terrorized, and in fear, given up freedoms in the name of security. We wrote secret laws. We built secret prisons. And the recent NSA leaks reveal: we lost more than we previously knew. But it's never too late to turn things around.

The many actions that followed Bush's speech were a disaster. But I this closing paragraph is beautiful, and hints at what could have been:

> Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, 
> and we know that God is not neutral between them.
> 
> (Applause)
> 
> Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice, assured 
> of the rightness of our cause and confident of the victories to come.

So choose freedom, not fear. [Refuse to be terrorized.](https://www.schneier.com/essay-124.html) Reclaim your rights.

This morning, I donated $100 to the EFF and another $100 to the ACLU. 

Don't just remember the day, take it as a call to action. Find your own way to promote freedom.
